        History and Origins:
        
        BMW originally started as an aircraft engine manufacturer, producing engines for the German military during World War I. After the war, the company shifted to making motorcycles in 1923 and then automobiles in 1928.
        Brand Identity:

        BMW produces a wide range of vehicles, including sedans (like the BMW 3 Series), SUVs (such as the BMW X5), and sports cars (like the BMW Z4). The company is also known for its M performance division, which produces high-performance versions of its standard models (e.g., BMW M3, M5).
        Electric and Hybrid Vehicles:
