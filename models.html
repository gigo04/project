    <p style="width: 50%; font-size: 150%;" >The Hofmeister kink fulfills at least two important design functions: On the one hand, it works well as a historical design link between BMWs of different generations, past, present, and future. And, it is a design element which helps the eye make the transition from the greenhouse area (that is, the windows, roof, and pillars) to the lower body of the car.</p>

    <p style="width: 50%; font-size: 150%;">
        But, where does the name Hofmeister kink come from? It dates back to former BMW Director of Body Engineering and Development Wilhelm Hofmeister. Incidentally, he was not a designer, but rather an engineer and a division manager. And, at that time, the division manager for body development was also the de facto head of BMW Design. Moreover, according to the BMW design expert Carp, one must admit: the distinctive kink is not a BMW invention, nor did it come from Hofmeister. It had already made its appearance on vehicle bodies in the 1940s, in automobiles from the USA and Italy. First in two-door coupés and even convertibles, and subsequently in saloons as well.

In the mid 1950s, there were already a few drawings showing a kink in the C-pillar. From 1960 on, there were serious proposals for it. According to Carp, the influence of the Italian designers Giovanni Michelotti and Giorgio Giugiaro (➜ Read also: How to create a classic) ensured that the element found its start in the design language of BMW  and, thanks to Hofmeister, that it remained.
